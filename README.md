Marshall is a robot that uses multiple ultrasonic sensors to detect the orientation and displacement of the plane to determine corrections and usher it to the correct parking spot. Using 4 servos, Marshall is able to signal to the pilot, with its servo controlled arms, the signals employed universally in every airport, allowing them to correct its course in real time, and safely park the aircraft.
